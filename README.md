## üß™ Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npm test
# or
npx playwright test
```

### Run tests with specific tag

```bash
TAG=TUI-001 npm test
```

### Run tests in headed mode (with browser UI)

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Run specific test file

```bash
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

### Run tests in debug mode

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### View test report

```bash
npm run report
```

### Code quality commands

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format

# Build TypeScript
npm run build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project is configured via `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Test Directory**: `./tests`
- **Test Filtering**: By TAG environment variable
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled (4 workers on CI, 1 locally)
- **Browsers**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
- **Reporter**: HTML (opens never)
- **Trace**: On first retry
- **Screenshots**: Only on failure
- **Video**: On (retain on failure for CI)
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Timezone**: Europe/Kyiv
- **Global Setup**: Configured via `global-setup.ts`

### Environment Variables

- `TAG`: Filter tests by tag (e.g., `TUI-001`)
- `CI`: Determines if running in CI environment
- `BASE_URL_UI`: Base URL for the application under test

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Tests

Tests are written using Playwright's test framework with Page Object Model pattern.

### Basic Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test description @TUI-001', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Expected Title/);
});
```

### Using Page Objects

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { MainPage } from '../src/pages/MainPage';

test('test with page object @TUI-001', async ({ page }) => {
    const mainPage = new MainPage(page);
    await mainPage.navigate();
    await expect(mainPage.title).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Test Tagging

Use tags in test names to filter tests:

```typescript
test('login functionality @TUI-001 @smoke', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
});
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names with tags
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Implement Page Object Model for reusability
- Use Playwright's built-in locators and assertions
- Add proper wait conditions
- Use environment-specific configurations

## üìä Reporting

After running tests, view the HTML report:

```bash
npm run report
# or
npx playwright show-report
```

Test results include:

- Test execution status and duration
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recordings (on by default, retained on failure for CI)
- Traces for debugging (on first retry)
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Test artifacts in `test-results/` directory

## üêõ Debugging

### VS Code Debugging

The project includes VS Code debug configurations:

1. **PW-DEBUG**: Run tests with debugger attached
2. **Debug Playwright with Inspector**: Use Playwright Inspector for step-by-step debugging

### Debug Settings

- `debug.focusWindowOnBreak`: Automatically focuses VS Code on breakpoints
- `debug.focusEditorOnBreak`: Focuses editor when hitting breakpoints

### Manual Debugging

Add `await page.pause()` in your test to open Playwright Inspector:

```typescript
test('debug test', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.pause(); // Opens Playwright Inspector
    // Continue with test steps
});
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

The project is configured for CI environments:

- Tests run with 2 retries on CI
- 4 workers on CI for faster execution
- Fails build if `test.only` is found
- Video recording retained on failure for CI
- Headless mode enabled on CI
- TAG-based test filtering support
